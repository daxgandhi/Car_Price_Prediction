🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on features like year, fuel type, transmission, and more.
It uses machine learning regression models trained on real-world car data.

📌 Problem Statement
Buying or selling a used car often involves uncertainty about the fair market price.
This project aims to help users estimate car prices accurately using data science and machine learning techniques.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
